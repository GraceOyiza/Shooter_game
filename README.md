# JavaScript capstone project - Shooter game

Building a turn-based shooter game using JavaScript and Phaser game engine

## GAME DESIGN DOCUMENTATION

#### Game Design

1. The initial step in designing the is to create a map. A world in which game will occur.
2. To create the scene with a dark background.
3. The game objects are nothing but simple images.
4. After the world, the biggest challenge in the game is to create a player that belongs to the map.
5. The player has to survive the enemies while trying to eliminate as many as they can.
6. While trying to eliminate obstacles, the player will also have to avoid contact with them.
7. Collision with the obstacles resulting in a game over.

#### Game play

The game currently contains one level, the velocity of the player and enemies is designed to become faster as the player earns a higher score. The player will fail if they collide with enemy spaceships. The main challenge in the game is coming in contact with enemies, which means automatic death for the player.

#### Assets choice

Choice of assets for the game was obtained from opengameart.org, this includes player, enemy, background.
